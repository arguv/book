<h2>Installing on Linux</h2>
<p>If you want to install Git on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora for example, you can use yum:</p>

  <pre>$ sudo yum install git</pre>
<p>If you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:</p>

  <pre>$ sudo apt-get install git</pre>
<p>For more options, there are instructions for installing on several different Unix flavors on the Git website, at <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/linux">http://git-scm.com/download/linux.</a></p>

<h2>Installing on Mac</h2>
<p>There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.</p>

<p>
If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. An OSX Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">http://git-scm.com/download/mac.</a>
You can also install it as part of the GitHub for Mac install. Their GUI Git tool has an option to install command line tools as well. You can download that tool from the GitHub for Mac website, at <a href="http://mac.github.com">http://mac.github.com.</a>
</p>

<h2>Installing on Windows</h2>
<p>There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">http://git-scm.com/download/win</a> and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows (also called msysGit), which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">http://msysgit.github.io/.</a> <br>

Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub for Windows. The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. It also works well with Powershell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings. We’ll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they’re things you want. You can download this from the GitHub for Windows website, at <a href="http://windows.github.com">http://windows.github.com.</a>

<h2>First-Time Git Setup</h2>
<h3>Your Identity</h3>
<p>
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
</p>
<pre>
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
</pre>

<div>
<pre>
git init
git add *
git commit -m "My initial commit message"
git remote add origin git@example.com:my_project.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>
