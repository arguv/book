			<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
		</div>

		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			JavaScript engines are just programs that convert JavaScript code into lower level code,
			so the computer can understand. These engines are embedded in browsers and web servers (Node.js)
			to allow run-time compilation and execution of code.
			JavaScript is usually categorized as interpreted although it is technically compiled.
			Modern JavaScript compilers actually perform <strong>Just-in-time Compilation</strong> which occurs during run-time.<br>

		<blockquote class="blockquote full-with">
			<strong>V8 Engine = Interpreter + Compiler = JIT (Just in Time) Compiler</strong><br>
			Interpreters:<br>
			(Convert to binary code)<br>
			Reads the js code line by line and converts to binary code and provides the result.<br>
			Cons:  Execution time for repeated code will be longer.<br>
			Compilers:<br>
			(Converts the code to another language)<br>
			Reads the entire code in the js file and converts to another language and provides the result.<br>
			Pros:  Less execution time is taken for the repeated code execution.

			<h2><strong>Parse</strong></h2>

		<blockquote class="blockquote full-with">
			We give a JavaScript file to the engine and it first does a lexical analysis.
			This breaks the code into something called tokens to identify their meaning.
			After that, we know what the code is trying to do.
