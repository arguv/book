					<h1>The SOLID Principles</h1>
					<p>SOLID is a acronym for five object-oriented design (OOD) principles that are intended to make software designs more understandable</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h2>S — (known as SRP) Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					A class should have a single responsibility. This principle dictates that a class should have ONLY one reason to change.
					This means that all the methods and properties should all work towards the same goal.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>O — (known as OCP) Open-Close Principle</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					This techniques dictates that a class should be open to extension and closed for modification.
					This means that your code should be written so that others (or a future you) can modify how it works without having to edit the existing code.
					When talking about making a class open for extension, the obvious thing to mention is class inheritance and interfaces.
					The interfaces shouldn't change (closed for modification) - however of course the implementation of these publicly facing methods should be open for extension in subclasses.
					If you want the Class to perform more functions, the ideal approach is to add to the functions that already exist NOT change them.
					This principle aims to extend a Class’s behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that Class.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>L — (known as LSP) Liskov Substitution Principle</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					By Barbara Liskov – "If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program."<br>
					This principle basically specifies that child classes should be suitable for their parent classes.
					This means it will adhere to the principles and functionality of the class it extends.
					When a child Class cannot perform the same actions as its parent Class, this can cause bugs.
					If you have a Class and create another Class from it, it becomes a parent and the new Class becomes a child.
					The child Class should be able to do everything the parent Class can do. This process is called Inheritance.
					The child Class should be able to process the same requests and deliver the same result as the parent Class or it could deliver a result that is of the same type.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>I — (known as ISP) Interface Segregation Principle</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					By Robert C Martin - The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use.
					So.. please stop making fat interfaces (remember, in PHP you can implement more than one interface in a class than one huge 'fat' interface).
					A Class should perform only actions that are needed to fulfil its role.
					Any other action should be removed completely or moved somewhere else if it might be used by another Class in the future.
					This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a Class executes ONLY the set of actions it requires.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>D — (known as DIP) Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
					Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.<br>
					<strong>High-level Module(or Class)</strong>: Class that executes an action with a tool.<br>
					<strong>Low-level Module (or Class)</strong>: The tool that is needed to execute the action.<br>
					<strong>Abstraction</strong>: Represents an interface that connects the two Classes.<br>
					<strong>Details</strong>: How the tool works<br>

					This principle says a Class should not be fused with the tool it uses to execute an action.
					Rather, it should be fused to the interface that will allow the tool to connect to the Class.
					It also says that both the Class and the interface should not know how the tool works.
					However, the tool needs to meet the specification of the interface.
					This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
