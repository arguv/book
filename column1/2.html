					<h1>Programming Principles</h1>
					<p>DRY , KISS , YAGNI</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h2><strong>DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself</strong></h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					“Don’t Repeat Yourself” – How many times do you see that there are similar codes in different parts of a system?
					The DRY principle, formulated by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer,
					states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
					In other words, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code.<br>

					On the other hand, when the DRY principle is not followed, this is known as WET solutions, which stands for either
					Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy Typing.
					DRY refers to code writing methodology. DRY usually refers to code duplication.
					If we write the same logic more than once, we should “DRY up our code.”
					This concept is advising us to divide code that does the same thing to small parts.
					Sometimes we have multiple lines of code basically doing the same: like filter by array with specified criteria,
					adding some things to object etc. Usually good practice is to get rid of it.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2><strong>KISS – Keep It Simple Stupid</strong></h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					The KISS principle was coined by Kelly Johnson, and it states that most systems work best
					if they are kept simple rather than making them complex; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design
					and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.<br>
					That means each method, class, interface should be names as clear as possible and also logic inside functions,
					method etc. should be clear and simple as it can be.<br>
					Each method should only solve one small problem, not many use cases. If you have a lot of conditions in the method, break these out into smaller methods.
					It will not only be easier to read and maintain but also can find bugs a lot faster.
					Keep your methods small, each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2><strong>YAGNI – You Aren’t Gonna Need It</strong></h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					A step brother of KISS. Part of keeping it simple is not adding modules, frameworks and dependencies we don’t actually need.
					That principle is not telling us how to do something in code directly, but rather how to code effectively.
					In general it says that we should code only things that are required from us in this particular moment.
					For example: when we will have to do validation of email and password field, we shouldn’t do validation of name, because we may never need it.
					`YAGNI` is trying to save us time and focus on most important things in our sprint.<br>
					You can’t waste time coding those features that you may end up needing to correct, change, or remove because they do not fit the needs of the product.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>TDA - Tell don’t ask</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					This principle suggest that we should write code in a way that object behave rather then in what state they are in.
					This can avoid unnecessary dependencies between classes and thanks to that have more maintainable code.
					It is strongly related to code encapsulation.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>TDD – Test Driven Development</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					Test Drive Development is the equivalent of eating all your veggies and exercising 3 times a week. Its good for you and everyone should be doing it.<br>
					TDD can be summed in 4 steps:<br>

					1. Decide on the desired functionality<br>
					2. Create the test for that functionality first. The test fails since no code exists yet.<br>
					3. Write the code that implements the desired functionality. The test now passes.<br>
					4. Repeat.<br>
					There are many studies that show this way of writing code is much more effiecient than the other way.
					Writing tests first ensures near 100% test code coverage. You’ll spend more time coding and less time debugging future errors.

					But like excercising regularly and eating veggies, few of us actually do it.
					And those of us who do make sure EVERYONE knows about it.
					We get it Bob, TDD changed your life and everything now please stop talking.
				</blockquote>

				<div>
					<h2>SOC – Separation of Concerns</h2>
				</div>

				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					This principle is telling us to separate responsibility of a single class to this class and this class only.
					Objects should not share what they do.
					Each class should be unique and separated from the rest.<br>
					There’s a reason there are so many different ways of reminding you to do just one thing.
					A lot of times you believe you’re doing just the one thing, but you then realize you can divide that one thing into several other smaller things.
